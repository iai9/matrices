This was originally supposed to just be a simple library for TWO_DIMENSIONAL matrices, not higher dimension tensors. see ".\matrices\matrix.py" for my code and go to ".\matrices\indiv_funcs\" to see each individual function and more detailed documentation. 

Since then, I've also added trigonometry because why not. located in ".\trig\trigonometry.py"



with matrices, we currently have:
*   Multiplication by scalar
*   Mutliplication of matrices
*   Addition of matrices
*   subtraction of matrices
*   tranpose
*   echelon
*   determinants
*   inverse

will be support for the following in the future:
*   no matrix operations I can think of right now, will add more if I think of more

with trig, we currently have:
*   degrees to pi-radians
*   pi-radians to degrees
*   simplest degrees
*   simplest pi radians
*   sin in pi-radians
*   cos in pi-radians
*   tan in pi-radians
*   csc in pi-radians
*   sec in pi-radians
*   cot in pi-radians
*   asin
*   acos
*   atan (note that atan does have a rather sizable margin of error or ~0.4 as input increases - working on this now)
