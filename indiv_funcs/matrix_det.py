the purpose of this program is to find the determinant of TWO DIMENSIONAL matrix in upper-triangle form

    array = [
            [a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., aN],
            [0, b2, b3, b4, ..., bN],
            [0, 0, c3, c4, ..., cN],
            ...,
            [0, 0, 0, 0, ..., zN]
    ]

i've already made a program to find the echelon form of a matrix, so I don't need to worry about that. 
Here, I will create
