This file is a compilation file - essentially a "library" of all of the matrix functions I have written
For information on each individual file, consult "./indiv_funcs/", a directory containing each individual file as i wrote them
In the future, that will likely not be maintained.

In general, this "library" is to be used with TWO DIMENSIONAL arrays in the form:

    array = [
        [a1, a2, a3, ..., aN],
        [b1, b2, b3, ..., bN],
        [c1, c2, c3, ..., cN],
        ...,
        [z1, z2, z3, ..., zN],
    ]

currently, there is support for:
*   Multiplication by scalar
*   Mutliplication of matrices
*   Addition of matrices
*   subtraction of matrices
*   tranpose
*   echelon
*   determinants
*   inverse

I have made an effort to provide good documentation. Where I felt it was necessary, I included time complexity of code
Keep in mind that although I've not found many bugs, that does not mean there are not cases under which this code will break

known bugs:    
    little to no argument validation
    inverse matrix has no clause for singular matrices

        the following for loop is where the actual formula happens
        the algorithm works as follows:

        assume we have an array, 
        we have the nth column and we want to make all elements of that column below 
        the nth row into 0

        say n =0 then we have:

        c1 = [           desired_c1 = [
              3                         3

              3                         0

                ]                         ]
        
        we can achieve this via subtracting a scalar multiple of the row such that we get 0
        ex. row 2. we can achieve row 1, col 2 equaling 0 by 
        subtracting row 1 * matrix[row1_idx][col2_idx]/matrix[row1_idx][row_idx]
