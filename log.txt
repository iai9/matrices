    ok starting this out. shoul dbe a bplast. pretty tired rn thugh so well see hwo long i can go beofre i pass out
    speaking of i feel lik epaassing out rohgt now. ill try to do some worj though

    going to begin work in /indiv_funcs rn. i will work on mutliplication of a matrix by a scalar

11-6-21 913pm:
    will include the addition of a fill_uneven function
    this will see if there are 2d arrays with uneven dimensions, ie a 3*6 but one of the rows is only 5 elements long
    it will then fill the empty spots. i will implement this later, however, and will for now assume that each argument is a completely filled matrix

    alright
    doing scalar mutliplication now
    should be easier than matrix mult

11-7-21 3:11pm:
    ok done. 
    will work on matrix addition and subtraction right now. there the same basically, but with one difference
    so i feel like doing them together should be fine
